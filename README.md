# Credit Defaults Logistic Regression
## Summary
Here I used logistic regression for hypothesis testing and to predict the likelihood of credit defaults based on the following factors: whether the individual was a student or not (student), credit balance (balance) and the individual's income (income). It was determined that student and balance were statistically significant predictors of default probability while income was not. Final regression coefficient output:

## Data Acquisition
I sourced the data from a built in dataset in the ISLR package in R called 'Default'. The data set includes 10000 observations.

## Data Analysis

Prior to performing any logistic regression I conducted some exploratory data analysis (EDA). I evaluated the relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable as well as the relationships between the independent variables. Two examples of EDA visualizations:
