## Summary
Here I used logistic regression for hypothesis testing and to predict the likelihood of credit defaults based on the following factors: whether the individual was a student or not (student), credit balance (balance) and the individual's income (income). It was determined that student and balance were statistically significant predictors of default probability while income was not. Final regression coefficient output:
